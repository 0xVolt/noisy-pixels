## Introduction

This repository aims to primarily help me remember how to program an algorithmic system and hopefully pique the interest of anyone that's stumbled on this repository. 

### `p5.js`

To start things off, I've developed this project using a JavaScript library named `p5.js`. Renowned for it's open-source and versatile approach to developing interactive graphics, `p5.js` is perfect for visualizing algorithmic systems. Over the years, this library has fostered an amazing and supportive community of creative coding enthusiasts that I'm proud to be a part of.
